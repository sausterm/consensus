State management is a critical aspect of modern web applications, especially as they grow in complexity. The core idea behind state management is to have a centralized, organized way to manage, update, and use the state data across your application.

React has its built-in state management system using useState and useReducer, which works perfectly for local states. However, when you need to share state across distant components in the component tree, prop-drilling (passing props through several layers of components) becomes cumbersome. That's where solutions like the Context API come in.

Context API
The Context API is a feature introduced in React to make it easier to share values (like state) between components without having to pass props down manually at every level.

Basic Concepts:
Context: It allows you to create a shared context (like ThemeContext in the example). Components can read from this context or modify it without the value being passed through every level of the component tree.

Provider: The Provider component wraps around any part of the component tree that needs access to the context. It has a value prop which accepts the data you want to share.

Consumer: Any component inside the Provider can access the context value. The most common way is using the useContext hook.


Example Explanation:
Let's dive into the provided example:

    const ThemeContext = React.createContext('light'); // default value

Here, a context for theme management (ThemeContext) is created with a default value of 'light'.
