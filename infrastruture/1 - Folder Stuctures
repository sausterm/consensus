1. **Folder Structure**:
    - Organize your project with a clear folder structure.
    - Components should be isolated to their own folder with associated styles, tests, and any utility files.
    - Consider following the feature-based structure rather than type-based.
       - src/
          - assets/: Static assets like images, fonts.
          - components/: Small reusable components (Button, Input, Modal).
          - features/: Feature-based components (UserList, UserProfile, Dashboard).
          - services/: APIs or other service-related functions.
          - utils/: Utility functions.
          - styles/: Global styles, mixins, or themes.
          - hooks/: Custom React hooks.
          - contexts/: React contexts for shared component state.
          - tests/: Test-related utilities or setup files.
